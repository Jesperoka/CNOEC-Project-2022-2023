# CNOEC-Project-2022-2023
Project for the course Constrained Numerical Optimization for Estimation and Control at Politecnico di Milano

### Useful things to remember

- Run **init.m** before trying to run **simulation.slx** (they're in **src/** and **src/simulation** respectively)
- You'll need: DSP Toolbox (required due to use of Simulink block) 
- And optionally: Parallel Computing Toolbox (for parallelization in fmincon, performance benefit depends on hardware)
